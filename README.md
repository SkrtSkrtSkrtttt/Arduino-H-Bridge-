# Arduino-H-Bridge-
H-Bridges are simple circuits utilized for alternating and manipulating signal polarities electronically. 
This technique is being  used for motor control and AC inverter along  with PWM signals to produce polarized analogous output power. 
The objective of this activity is to learn and build an H-bridge to control a DC motor using bare minimum components.
The goal for this task is to create a single function to control the motor including all the driving and stopping modes, CW, CCW, Brake, and Coast.
